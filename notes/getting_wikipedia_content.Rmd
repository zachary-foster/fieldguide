```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Getting the page text

### downloading content

```{r}

wp_content <- WikipediR::page_content("en","wikipedia", page_name ="holodiscus discolor")
str(wp_content)
```

### Saving to a file

Simply saving the content does not render images or links correctly:

```{r}
writeChar(wp_content$parse$text[["*"]], con= "test.html")
```

* all links are realtive, so they dont work. 
* css is not there
